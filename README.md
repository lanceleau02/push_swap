# **push_swap**

**Because swap_push isnâ€™t as natural.**

</div>

## Features

- Implement a program to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations.
- Use two stacks (`a` and `b`) for sorting operations.
- Support specific operations: `sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, and `rrr`.
- Optimize the number of operations to achieve the sorting.
- Handle input validation for duplicates and invalid arguments.
- Provide efficient sorting algorithms for different input sizes.
- Ensure compliance with time and space complexity requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
